Build a production-ready Student & Staff Management System.

The system must allow administrators to manage students and staff records. 
Staff members can login and view assigned students.
Administrators can create, update, and delete both students and staff.

Students belong to departments.
Staff have roles (ADMIN or STAFF).
The system must support secure authentication and role-based authorization.

The interface should allow filtering, searching, and pagination for large datasets.
